# KNN-and-KMeans-Algorithm

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It classifies data points based on the majority class of their k-nearest neighbors, using distance metrics like Euclidean distance. K-Means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that partitions data into k clusters by minimizing intra-cluster variance. It iteratively assigns data points to the nearest centroid and updates centroids until convergence. While KNN is effective for classification tasks, K-Means is widely used for clustering and pattern recognition.

Objectives of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
Classify Data Points – Assign labels to new data based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors.
Pattern Recognition – Identify similarities and relationships within labeled datasets.
Non-Parametric Learning – Operate without making assumptions about data distribution.
Adaptive Learning – Improve classification with increasing data, making it effective for real-time applications.

Objectives of K-Means Clustering:
Unsupervised Data Segmentation – Group similar data points into clusters without prior labels.
Pattern Discovery – Identify hidden structures and relationships in large datasets.
Dimensionality Reduction – Simplify data representation by clustering similar points.
Efficient Data Analysis – Improve decision-making by categorizing data into meaningful groups.
